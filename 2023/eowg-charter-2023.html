    <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
    <p>Accessibility is a key aspect of W3C's commitment to a Web for All. W3C standards include accessibility guidelines and technical specifications. However, accessibility is not as widely known and understood as many areas of W3C work. Understanding and implementing W3C's accessibility standards is quite complex. The Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group addresses these challenges and <span class="listintro">supports W3C's mission by</span>: </p>
    <ul class="listafterp listspaced">
      <li><strong>Promoting W3C standards and resources for accessibility</strong>: Maintaining and extending the broad recognition of W3C standards and resources for accessibility, to further strengthen the credibility, authority, and trust in W3C as the leading technical body for web accessibility. </li>
      <li><strong>Supporting uniform uptake of W3C standards for accessibility</strong>: Contributing to harmonized adoption of W3C standards in national and international standardization efforts (e.g. US Section 508, European EN 301 549, etc.), to enable organizations to use W3C standards and supporting educational, technical, and evaluation resources across multiple international markets.</li>
      <li><strong>Supporting implementation of W3C standards for accessibility</strong>: Assisting a broad audience (developers, designers, project managers, etc.), including W3C membership, in understanding and implementing W3C standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Engaging the community around W3C standards and resources</strong>: Engaging a wide multi-stakeholder community (industry, experts, researchers, users, etc.), throughout the development of W3C standards and resources, to improve the quality, consensus, and acceptance. </li>
      <li><strong>Demonstrating W3C leadership in building a better web</strong>: Reinforcing the leadership of W3C as the go-to standardization body for web standards, to support the mission of leading the web to its full potential and to promote the universality of the web.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="listintro">EOWG resources have proven valuable to promoting understanding, implementing, and testing conformance to W3C accessibility standards. The community relies on authoritative support from EOWG resources, for example:</p>
    <ul class="listafterp">
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/">Web Accessibility Tutorials</a></li>

      <li>and many of the <a href="WAI Resources">WAI Resources</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This charter proposes continuing the Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group to maintain continuity of established W3C Member engagement in successfully developing deliverables consistent with <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#GAGeneral">W3C Process definition of a Working Group</a>.</p>

    <p id="public">Discussions for this Working Group are <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">publicly</a> archived: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Drafts of resources will be developed in public repositories and that allow direct public contribution. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation.</p>
    <p>Information about the group (including links to details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/eowg/">EOWG home page</a>.</p>
    <p>This group primarily conducts its work through <a id="public-github" href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/eowg/tools">GitHub issues</a>.
      The public is invited to review, discuss, and contribute to this work. </p>
    <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="decisions">
    <h2>Decision Policy </h2>
    <p>This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
    <p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.</p>
    <p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. Group participants can comment on provisional decisions within 7 working days. Approvals to publish are conducted by web-based survey, usually with a response period of <span id='cfc'>at least 7 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
      
      If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group. </p>
    <p>All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director. </p>
    <p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>

  <section id="patentpolicy">
    <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
    <p>The Working Group provides an opportunity to
      share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
      Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
      disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
      6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
      produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
      participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
      Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
      please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/[shortname]/ipr">licensing information</a>.</p>

      <p>This section lists substantive changes from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/charter2020">previous charter</a>, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#CharterReview">W3C Process Document (section 4.3, Advisory Committee Review of a Charter)</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For this charter, EOWG is focusing on: 1. Completing in-progress deliverables. 2. Updating existing deliverables. Rational: Several existing deliverable need updating, and that will take a fair bit of effort.</li>
        <li>The following  are added to the Deliverables:
          <ul>
            <li><cite>Web Accessibility Tutorials</cite></li>
            <li><cite>How People with Disabilities Use the Web</cite></li>
            <li><em>Resource Updates</em></li>
            <li>Contributing to <em>Training on W3C Accessibility Standards</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The following are removed from the Deliverables:
          <ul>
            <li><cite>Curricula on Web Accessibility</cite> &mdash; Rational: Curricula work is completed.</li>
            <li><em>Video Resources</em> &mdash; Rational: Planned video work is complete. Additional work may be defined within EOWG's scope.</li>
            <li><em>Authoring Tool Accessibility Support Resources</em> &mdash; Rational: Defined deliverables completed. Additional work may be defined within EOWG's scope.</li>
            <li><em>WCAG Support Materials</em> &mdash; Rational: EOWG's defined work in complete. Additional work may be defined within EOWG's scope.</li>
            <li><cite>Before and After Demonstration (BAD) &mdash; </cite>Rational: This is a large project beyond current and expected EOWG resources for this charter period. EOWG prioritized other work higher.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><cite>Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Mapping (ARRM)</cite> moved from Planned Deliverables to Potential EOWG Deliverables. Rational: Previous work has been slow and we are not confident that we can complete it in this charter period. There are  open issues on what EOWG would publish and the potential review burden on other Working Groups.</li>
      </ul>
