        href="https://www.w3.org/2021/sdw/">Spatial Data on the Web
        Working Group</a> is to:

      <ul>
        <li>develop and maintain vocabularies and best practices that
          encourage better sharing of spatial data on the Web;

        <li>identify areas where standards should be developed <strong
          >jointly</strong> by both W3C and the <a
          href="https://www.ogc.org">Open Geospatial Consortium</a>
          (OGC).

        <h2>Scope</h2>

        <p>The Spatial Data on the Web WG will:

        <ul>
          <li>Create and maintain geospatial Web standards and
            geospatial profiles of more general standards as enumerated
            in deliverables.

          <li>Coordinate among incubation groups, by providing a forum
            where early ideas for geospatial Web standards can be
            shared, identifying ideas for further standardisation by
            W3C and/or OGC, and making recommendations about these
            incubations to the relevant standards body or bodies.
            Related incubation will generally happen in W3C Community
            Groups and OGC Innovation Program initiatives.

          <li>Respond to requests from OGC Architecture Board (OAB)
            and W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) to review
            materials relating to Geospatial Web standards, and
            proactively bring relevant matters to the attention of the
            OAB and TAG.

          <li>Periodically review and amend the OGC Technology Trends,
            <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/ideas/issues"
            >OGC Innovation Program</a> ideas issue tracker and <a
            href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/labels/Geospatial"
            >W3C strategic incubation pipeline ("funnel")</a> to
            identify, prioritise and track important ideas relating to
            geospatial Web standards.

                <li>Abstract: OWL-Time is an OWL-2 DL ontology of
                  temporal concepts, for describing the temporal
                  properties of resources in the world or described in
                  Web pages. The ontology provides a vocabulary for
                  expressing facts about topological (ordering)
                  relations among instants and intervals, together with
                  information about durations, and about temporal
                  position including date-time information. Time
                  positions and durations may be expressed using either
                  the conventional (Gregorian) calendar and clock, or
                  using another temporal reference system such as
                  Unix-time, geologic time, or different calendars.

          of every feature defined in the specification, where
          interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites,
          and two or more implementations interoperating with each
          other.

        <p>There should be testing plans for each specification,
          starting from the earliest drafts.

        <p><span class=todo>Consider adopting a healthy testing
          policy, such as:</span> To promote interoperability, all
          changes made to specifications in Candidate Recommendation or

<!-- Horizontal review -->

          >horizontal review</a> for accessibility,
          internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant

          title="Technical           Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major

          Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the
          horizontal review groups throughout development of each
          specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review
          at least 3 months before first entering <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR"
          title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major
          changes occur in a specification following a review.

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups
          will be made, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C

        <h2> Communication</h2>

        <p id=public> Technical discussions for this Working Group are
          conducted in <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels"
          >public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and
          face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and
          technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in
          a manner that can be both read and written to by the general
          public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications
          will be developed in public repositories and may permit
          direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves
          are not open to public participation, however.

        <p>Information about the group (including details about
          deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
          meetings) will be available from the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/2021/sdw/">Spatial Data on the Web

        <p>Most Spatial Data on the Web Working Group teleconferences
          will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and
          will be conducted on an as-needed basis.

        <p>This group primarily conducts its technical work <i
          class=todo>pick one, or both, as appropriate:</i> on the
          public mailing list <a class=todo

          and contribute to this work.

        <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for
          administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs
          and members of the group, for member-only discussions in
          special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
      </section>

      <section id=decisions>
        <h2> Decision Policy</h2>

        <p> This group will seek to make decisions through consensus
          and due process, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C
          Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically,
          an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal,
          which is then refined in discussion with members of the group
          and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal
          voting being required.

        <p> However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress
          and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of
          the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group
          vote and record a decision along with any objections.

        <p> To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational
          deliberation, any resolution (including publication
          decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference
          will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC)
          will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email,
          GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period
          from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's
          evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no
          objections are raised by the end of the response period, the
          resolution will be considered to have consensus as a
          resolution of the Working Group.

        <p>All decisions made by the group should be considered
          resolved unless and until new information becomes available
          or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.

        <p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C
          Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and
          includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process
          Document requires.
